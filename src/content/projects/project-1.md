**Project Overview**

Showz Customer LTV & ROI Analysis is a data-driven project focused on understanding customer behavior and optimizing marketing investments. The analysis explores how much value customers bring to the company (LTV), how effectively marketing investments generate returns (ROI), and where the balance between cost and value is achieved.

**Objectives**

1. Analyze customer activity data, including visits, purchases, and marketing campaign performance.

2. Calculate the Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) and Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) to evaluate profitability.

3. Determine the Return on Investment (ROI) for marketing efforts and identify optimization opportunities.

4. Detect the break-even point where customer-generated revenue surpasses acquisition costs.

**Key Analyses and Features**

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Comprehensive analysis of user visits, orders, and marketing campaigns to uncover behavioral trends and correlations.

2. Cohort Analysis:

- Examination of customer retention and behavior over time to identify long-term engagement patterns.

3. LTV & CAC Calculation:

- Quantitative assessment of how much each customer contributes in revenue versus how much it costs to acquire them.

4. ROI & Break-Even Insights:

- Evaluation of marketing performance and identification of the point where investments start generating net positive returns.

**Repository Structure**

data/ – Contains both raw (raw/) and processed (processed/) datasets.

notebooks/ – Jupyter notebooks documenting each step of the analysis process.

src/ – Python scripts with reusable functions for data cleaning and analysis.

reports/ – Visualizations and reports generated throughout the project.

requirements.txt – List of dependencies required to run the analysis.

**Technology Stack**

- Python Libraries:
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly (optional), jupyter

**Key Metrics**

- CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)
