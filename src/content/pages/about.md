## Andres Estrada – Data Analyst based in France

**Greetings!** I’m Andres Estrada, a [Colombian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia)-born Data Analyst currently living near the beautiful [French Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Alps). I’m a proactive individual with a strong ability to learn and an ongoing drive to develop new skills. My passion lies in transforming data into meaningful insights that guide strategic and informed decision-making.

## Skills and Expertise

I specialize in data collection, interpretation, and visualization, using data-driven methods to uncover patterns, optimize performance, and support business growth. My toolkit includes tools and technologies such as **Python**, **SQL**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Tableau**, which I use to turn complex datasets into clear, actionable results.

Before transitioning into Data Analytics, I spent seven years as a poultry producer, managing daily operations, optimizing production processes, and analyzing performance metrics. This experience gave me a deep understanding of operational data, efficiency, and the power of digital tools in improving productivity.

## Analytical Thinking and Problem-Solving

I thrive on solving complex challenges by combining analytical thinking with practical experience. Whether it’s exploring data trends, improving processes, or building dashboards, I approach every project with curiosity, precision, and a commitment to creating real value.

## Global Perspective, Local Insight

Living in France has broadened my perspective on how data shapes industries across different regions. My Colombian roots have taught me adaptability and resilience, while my international experience helps me approach analysis with both cultural sensitivity and global awareness.

## Continuous Growth

The ever-evolving nature of Data Analytics inspires me to keep learning. I’m constantly exploring new tools, techniques, and technologies that enhance data storytelling and decision-making capabilities. My goal is to stay ahead of the curve and continue growing as a professional in the data field.

## Collaboration and Communication

I believe that data becomes truly powerful when shared effectively. I enjoy collaborating with teams, communicating findings clearly, and turning insights into strategies that drive measurable impact.

## Get in Touch

Are you looking to uncover insights hidden in your data or optimize performance through analytics?
I’d love to connect and collaborate on projects that make a difference.
